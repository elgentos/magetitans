Since creating the first true Web production company in Austin Texas in 1994, the first coverage of a live sporting 
event in 1995 and the first “price-your-own-car” website in 1997, Bret Williams has been an innovator and confessed 
“Maverick” in the world of online business. After building his own eCommerce platform in 2005 to power an online store 
that became the leader in its niche, Bret dove into Magento in 2010 as the most significant SMB platform of its time. 
Bret has written four bestsellers on Magento and continues to build creative solutions for B2C and B2B clients of his 
agency, novusweb. Bret and his business partner (and wife), Cyndi, live and work in Austin, Texas, serving a diverse 
group of global clients.
