## The talk: {{ page.title }}

<p>"Being a senior developer is a great accomplishment, but what comes next can be a confusing and challenging question. Should you stay in development, make the switch to management, or take the entrepreneurial leap? The truth is, there is no single answer. Every developer's journey is unique, and there is no one-size-fits-all career path.</p>

<p>Andreas is a developer who faced this dilemma and recently made a decision that resulted in a major change in the management structure of integer_net. You will hear about the different options he considered and the factors that influenced his choice. This is not a lecture on the ""right"" way to proceed, but rather a personal story about a developer who dared to chart his own course."</p>
