## The talk: {{ page.title }}

<p>"The Hyv채 checkout is new and awesome, and it uses Magewire. But it does a lot of things differently compared to the Luma checkout, and that introduces a learning curve.

I have built integrations for various Payment Service Providers (PSP) for both the Luma Checkout and the Hyv채 Checkout. Integrating them into the Luma checkout can be a challenge. They have their own SDKs, or you must execute specific steps within a particular order. It is never straightforward.

This is not different in the Hyv채 Checkout, but it offers different ways to address different challenges. In this talk, I'll walk you through some of the lessons that I've learned along the way."</p>
