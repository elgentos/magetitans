We all know we should do it. But where to start? What should we test? Do I need a CI pipeline to test? How to convince 
the manager to spend time on testing?

These are all valid questions, and I hope to answer them all for you. I've been adding tests to my code for a few years 
now, and I'm at the point where adding tests speed up my development instead of slowing it down. But the road to this 
point can be bumpy. I hope to give you a head start and improve your code.

Hi, I’m Michiel. I am working in the e-commerce industry for over 10 years as a developer. When I started I worked with 
small retailers. After working for different agencies I am now working as a freelancer for companies with millions and 
millions of revenue. I loved tested code that looks great and works even better.
