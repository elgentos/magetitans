The current ecosystem of Magento gives room for both bad and good extensions. Of course, if you are one of the cool 
kids, you are only high-quality extensions or even better, you only rely on your code. But in real-life, the success of 
Magento is there thanks to the 1000s of extensions that allow you to easily modify the Magento system. And often, these 
extensions do these things in dead-ugly ways, that make you work hard once you need to track issues or develop 
custom-code on top of it.

How to prevent this from happening? Not using any extension is not the answer. Only relying on trustworthy extensions is 
part of the answer, but how do you define what is trustworthy? This talk goes through a series of known checks on which 
to base extension quality (code quality, testing, yadayada) but it goes a step further: It discusses on how to enforce 
MFTF, how to guarantee certain dependency tracking, how to do code reviews, how to apply Marketplace checks on 
non-Marketplace code. It discusses this in the light of new changes (headless; Adobe; climate change). Part of it is to 
explain the efforts of Magento Marketplace and ExtDN. Part of it is a personal brainfart. Part of it is an open question 
on where to move with Magento next. This is meant as a feedback-driven talk to ask ourselves the question what we can do 
to help the ecosystem of extensions improve.

I'm the owner, developer and trainer of Yireo, providing numerous Magento extensions to the community, but also training 
frontend developers and backend developers throughout Europe. I was awarded a Magento Mastership for organizing 
usergroup meetings, hackathons and developer conferences like MageTestFest and Reacticon. I'm also part of ExtDN, the 
Magento extension developer network.
