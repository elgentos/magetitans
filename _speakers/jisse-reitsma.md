## The talk: {{ page.title }}

<p>"Magento development is often seen as difficult. We can do better. Generating code with AI seems like the easy trick, but it's only part of a huge toolbox that helps us develop more efficiently: Testing, analysis tools, development helpers. This talk gives you the management summary and teases you to do more with Magento."</p>
