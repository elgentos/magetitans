## The talk: {{ page.title }}

<p>In this talk, we will start from the basics in Varnish, compare different invalidation methods and move on to more complex matters. I will share my experience with xKey (and soft purging) about the good and the bad we have noticed at Savvii.</p>

## About {{ page.name }}

<p>Toon started as a Magento developer at PHPro in 2012. After a while, his tasks were mostly focussed on performance. After taking a short break from Magento to learn more about other languages and frameworks, and work in a high traffic environment, he started working at MageHost as a DevOps and performance specialist. Two years after, MageHost was merged into Savvii.</p>
<p>Toon has a strong interest in complex hosting setups, helping customers solve complex issues and performance tuning.</p>
