## The talk: {{ page.title }}

<p>In this talk, I will share the journey of building Magewire 3 from a clean slate, leveraging the knowledge accumulated from developing Magewire 1. Throughout this process, I faced numerous challenges, especially in making the porting of Laravel packages more enjoyable and beneficial for Magewire 3. The journey has been demanding, particularly with the extensive feature set of Livewire, which I aim to integrate into Magento. Despite the difficulties, this has been an insightful experience, marked by valuable lessons learned and significant innovations achieved.</p>
