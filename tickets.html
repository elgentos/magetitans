                Mage Titans is open to all, it has something for every level of Magento developer. Learn new things and
                network with your fellow developers whilst enjoying a variety of presentations and panel discussions.
                There will also be an opportunity to provide feedback, so if there are any topics you’d like us to cover
                at future events, we want to know!
